# 🩺 SymptomSense AI – Disease Prediction Model

> 🧠 **AI-powered diagnostic assistance built with Python & Machine Learning.**

Welcome to **SymptomSense**, a smart health-tech project that bridges the gap between symptoms and diagnosis. By leveraging a **Random Forest** algorithm, this model analyzes user-reported symptoms to predict the most likely health conditions with clinical-grade accuracy. It’s designed to be fast, lightweight, and incredibly easy to integrate into any web application.

## 🔌 Web Developer’s Guide (Integration)

Your friend building the web app needs these **3 core files** to make the "magic" happen:

1. **`symptom_model.pkl`**: The trained intelligence.
2. **`symptom_encoder.pkl`**: Translates AI numbers into human disease names.
3. **`symptom_features.json`**: The master list of 132 symptoms.

### 💡 How to take input?

To get a prediction, the frontend should send a list of symptom names. The backend then creates a "1 and 0" list (Vector) where:

* **1** = User has this symptom.
* **0** = User does NOT have this symptom.
## 🌐 Live API Integration (For Web Developers)

The model is deployed as a live REST API on Render. You can send symptoms to it and receive the top 3 predicted diseases.

### 📍 API Endpoint
**POST** `https://symptons-api.onrender.com/predict`

**Clone My Repo**: 'https://github.com/QuantumCoder-001/symptons'

### 📥 Request Body (JSON)
The API expects a JSON object with a key named `symptoms` containing a list of symptom names.
```json
{
  "symptoms": ["itching", "skin_rash", "fatigue"]
}
